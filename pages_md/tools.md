## Text editing {#te}

A generic [Text Editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) is
used to create and modify a Lexware file.
[Jim Kari](https://www.uaf.edu/anlc/emeritus.php#kari) and
[Tim Montler](http://www.montler.net/) use
[EditPad Pro](https://www.editpadpro.com/), for Windows. For the
current project we wanted to develop and promote a solution that was
free and open source, and which could be used for Windows, Mac, and
Linux. We recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/).

We have developed a
[Lexware language](https://github.com/alaskanlc/language-lexware)
package for Atom that provides i) syntax coloring, and ii) keyboard
shortcuts for common Dene non-Latin characters.  The package can be
easily installed from within Atom: just open Preferences, click the
Install tab, and search for “Lexware”. Click the Install button on
`language-lexware`.  Tim Montler has developed a syntax coloring mode
for EditPad Pro, and a Dene package for the key mapping software
[Keyman](https://keyman.com/); please contact Tim for these packages.
