## Text editing {#te}

A generic [Text Editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) is
used to create and modify a Lexware file.
[Jim Kari](https://www.uaf.edu/anlc/emeritus.php#kari) and
[Tim Montler](http://www.montler.net/) use
[EditPad Pro](https://www.editpadpro.com/), for Windows. For the
current project we wanted to develop and promote a solution that was
free and open source, and which could be used for Windows, Mac, and
Linux. We recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/).

We have developed a
[Lexware language](https://github.com/alaskanlc/language-lexware)
package for Atom that provides i) syntax coloring, and ii) keyboard
shortcuts for common Dene non-Latin characters.  The package can be
easily installed from within Atom: just open Preferences, click the
Install tab, and search for “Lexware”. Click the Install button on
`language-lexware`.  Tim Montler has developed a syntax coloring mode
for EditPad Pro, and a Dene package for the key mapping software
[Keyman](https://keyman.com/); please contact Tim for these packages.

## Concurrent editing {#ce}

If at any point there might be more than one person working on a
Lexware file, including an assistant who may help with validation and
formatting, it may be expediant to use a concurrent versioning
system. Most academics are now familiar with the concurrent editing in
Google Docs, but this resources was preceeded by decades of tools
available for software code writers to collaborate on projects. The
most popular code sharing site today is [Github](https://github.com),
which uses the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) versioning system.  Because
a Lexware file is ‘line-oriented’, it is very similar to software
code, using Github to manage Lexware editing is a good choice. Github
“repos” can be either public or private, and you may choose to keep
your working copy of a lexware file private. There are many guides to
using Github, and the Atom editor has built-in Github capabilities.

However, if collaborators would prefer to use GoogleDocs, it is
possible to adapt GoogleDocs to facilitiate Lexware editing. Please
see [here]() for a guide to adding syntax coloration to your Lexware
file. At this time it is not possible to customize keystokes in Google
Docs, so some other approach must be found for adding Dene diacritics.

## Lexware file grammar {#g}

No Lexware syntax validation is available in the text editor itself,
and the writer must carefully avoid band label typos, and adhere to
the band order defined in the the [grammar](grammar.html). Elements of
a Lexware file that are out of order are not ‘wrong’ per se, but will
not generate standardized dictionary entries and will not be available
for analysis.
