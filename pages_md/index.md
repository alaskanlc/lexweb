# Lexicography tools for Dene languages

“Lexware” comprises a file format and collection of tools for
dictionary building, developed by Bob Hsu at the University of Hawaii
starting in the 1970s.  Despite the availability of more modern
dictionary-building software, Lexware still offers some major
advantages, in particular the _flexibility_ to immediately add new
data elements for a word entry as the understanding (modeling) of a
language grows. This flexibility comes from a Lexware file being
simply a plain text file with lines (“bands”) arranged in an order
determined by a schema limited only by the user’s imagination.

One group of lexicographers still using Lexware are those working on
the **Dene Athabaskan languages of Alaska**, at the University of Alaska,
Fairbanks, and elsewhere. In 2018, Cam Webb started software support
work with lexicographers Jim Kari and Jason Harris, who were working
on Lower Tanana and Gwich’in dictionaries (respectively). These pages and tools are the result of
this work. The outputs of this project are:

 1. A Dene Lexware [schema](grammar.html) (or ‘grammar’)
 2. A Lexware file [validator](tools.html) against this schema
 3. A Lexware-to-formatted-dictionary [converter](tools.html)
 4. A Lexware [language package](https://github.com/alaskanlc/language-lexware)
    in the cross-platform Atom text editor
