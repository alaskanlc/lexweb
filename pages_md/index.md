# Lexicography tools for Dene languages

“Lexware” comprises a file format and collection of tools for
dictionary building, originally developed by Bob Hsu at the University
of Hawaii starting in the 1970s.  Despite the availability of more
modern dictionary-building software, Lexware still offers some major
advantages, in particular the _flexibility_ to immediately add new
data elements for a word entry as the understanding (modeling) of a
language grows.

One group of lexicographers still using Lexware are those working on
the **Dene Athabaskan languages of Alaska**, at the University of
Alaska, Fairbanks, and elsewhere. In 2018, Cam Webb started
informatics support work for lexicographers Jim Kari and Jason Harris,
who are working on Lower Tanana and Gwich’in dictionaries
(respectively). These pages and tools are the result of this work. The
outputs of this project are a Dene Lexware ‘[grammar](grammar.html)’,
a Lexware file [validator](tools.html), a 
Lexware-to-formatted-dictionary [converter](tools.html), and 
[tools](https://github.com/alaskanlc/language-lexware) for editing
Lexware files.
