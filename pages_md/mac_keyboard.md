# Mac keyboard layout for Gwich’in

This page offers a keyboard layout file to assist with Gwich’in
diacritics, plus installation and usage instructions.

## Installation

First download this XML file called
[Gwichin.keylayout](../files/Gwichin.keylayout) (Hold down the Control
key, and then click on the link and ‘Save As...’).

Next you need to get the `Gwichin.keylayout` file to the `Keyboard
Layouts` folder in the `Library` folder. Mac hides the `Library`
folder from you usually, but you can see it this way: In the Finder:

 1. Find the `Gwichin.keylayout` file you just downloaded. It will not
    be called `Gwichin.keylayout`, but just `Gwichin` because Mac
    hides the suffix from you. Copy the file (Command-C).
 2. Hold down the Option (aka Alt) key, and click on the Go menu item;
    you should see ‘Library’ listed - click on it.
 3. Find the `Keyboard Layouts` folder and paste the file inside that
    folder (Command-V).
 
Finally, go the System Preferences, and click on Keyboard.  Make sure
the ‘Show Input menu in menu bar’ box is checked. In the ‘Input
Sources’ tab, click on ‘+’ to add a new source. Scroll down and click
on ‘Others’. You should see ‘Gwich’in’ listed. Click on it.

## Usage

When you want to input Gwich’in diacritic characters, click on the
flag in the top-right of the menu bar, and select ‘Gwich’in’. Go to
the document you are editing. All normal (small) characters, and Shift
(capital) characters are still available as usual, and the usual
Command characters (e.g. Command-Tab for switch window) still
work. But certain combinations of Control and Option will give
Gwich’in diacritics to certain keys:

```
 OPT       + a -> ą
       CTL + a -> à
 OPT + CTL + a -> ą̀

 OPT       + e -> ę
       CTL + e -> è
 OPT + CTL + e -> ę̀

 OPT       + i -> į
       CTL + i -> ì
 OPT + CTL + i -> ̀į

 OPT       + o -> ǫ
       CTL + o -> ò
 OPT + CTL + o -> ̀ǫ

 OPT       + u -> ų
       CTL + u -> ù
 OPT + CTL + u -> ų̀

 OPT        + l -> ł
 OPT + SHFT + l -> Ł
```
